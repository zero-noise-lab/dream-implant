Editable and printable constituent components of the DREAM implant

ASSEMBLY

Assembly instructions can be found in the BioArxiv protocol.

Printing

The .stl files are optimized for Formlabs Form2 printer and Grey FLGPGR04 (https://formlabs.com/uk/materials/standard/#greyscale-resins). For other printers and/or resins, some modifications may be necessary. Modifications can be conducted on the .X_T files provided. Additionally, a general purpose MiniAmp Holder not described in the paper has been added to this repo, this can be used during surgery, or alternatively during probe or amp testing. An additional component that is required is an x by x dowel pin to restrain the MiniAmp through the two lateral holes that can be found in the design.
