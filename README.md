# Editable and printable constituent components of the DREAM implant

## Assembly
Assembly instructions can be found in the [BioArxiv protocol](https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2024.02.26.582029v1).

## Printing
The .stl files are optimized for Formlabs Form2 printer and [Grey FLGPGR04](https://formlabs.com/uk/materials/standard/#greyscale-resins). For other printers and/or resins, some modifications may be necessary. Modifications can be conducted on the .X_T files provided. This is a Parasolid Model Part file that can be edited using programmes such as SOLIDWORKS, OnShape and Siemens NX.

Additionally, a general purpose MiniAmp Holder not described in the paper has been added to this repo, this can be used during surgery, or alternatively during probe or amp testing. An additional component that is required is an 0.8x20mm dowel pin to restrain the MiniAmp through the two lateral holes that can be found in the design.

## R2Drive
Drive files can be found at https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Metal_recoverable. Files there contain design files for printable drive holders, as well as metal drive files, ordering instructions and assembly instructions.
